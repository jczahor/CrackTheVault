//Cracking the code step by step breakdown
//Create a string for the user saying: You have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret combination...
//Assign three variables. Each variable contains the corresponding result of calculation using a unique arithmetic operator(+-*/). Each must equal one of the three codes in the combination.
//Add comments throughout the code to explain each step in the process.
//Create a dialog box displaying the vault codes and the text if using HTML and a script tag, or create a popup dialog.
//Please submit either a file with your code or a screenshot of the code, with the pseudocode showing, or a GitHub link.


//STEPS TO COMPLETE
//1. Code string for user saying YOU HAVE RECIEVED THIS MESSAGE,and consent.
//2. Create variable one with arithmetic to make 10
//4. Create variable two with arithmetic to make 40
//5. Create variable three with arithmetic to make 39
//6. Alert user to secret combination via variables


//We want the three variables coded, and then displayed to the user the result via a prompt 


//Step 1 
const chosenOne = prompt("You have recieved this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret combination... Agree?" ) 


//Step 2
const combo1 = (11-1)

//Step 3
const combo2 = (5*8)

//Step 4
const combo3 = (78/2)

//Step 5
const combos = prompt(combo1 combo2 combo3)
